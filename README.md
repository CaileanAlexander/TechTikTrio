This is a college assignment IOT Project **Team name: TECHTIKTRIO**
- The aim is to establish a problem and come up with an IOT solution 

**The problem** - extremes of weather causing adverse affects for farmers

**The soultion** - A smart clock that will create/send alerts when specific weather conditions are met.

Equiptment used:

- Arduino Uno 4
- Grove Base Hat (Sheild)
- LCD RGB Backlight
- Buzzer
- Temperature Sensor
- LED
- Light Sensor
- Button
- Grove Cables
  


The clock will have an lcd screen and show the time (time starts on initialisation) - (future iterations could include a touch screen and app alerts sent to phone, and an RTC module would be more effective to show the current time)

Sensors included will be temperature and light - (future iterations could include moisture etc..)

A buzzer, button and Led light will help to alert the farmer when a sensor picks up a condition that has been established by the farmer, for example freezing temperature or when the sun rises.

**What the equipment is expected to do:**
LCD Screen - This will display the time and any warning alerts that may occur.

Buzzer - this will sound when a sensor picks up an alerting factor i.e. when an alarm is set for a specific time, when the sun rises, when it is a specific temperature either hot or cold.

button - this will be utilized to turn the buzzer off. (Future iterations would include more buttons, for example to set an alarm time i.e. one for minuets and one for hours

led light - this will light up when an alarm occurs.

Light Sensor - this will pick up light levels and will send a signal when an established condition is met

Temperature Sensor - this sensor detects the temperature and will send an alert when a specific temperature is detected i.e. when the sensor picks up a temperature of 2 degrees celcius it could send a notification, warning of the risk of ice and freezing temperatures.
